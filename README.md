Not really a library, just a folder that you can git clone if you for some reason need to work with .EXT-Files!<br>
I've made this because of a bigger program I am currently working on, and I thought, maybe someone needs just a library for readon .EXT-Files I guess.

## Installation
As I said, I have no experience making "libraries" so I guess just copy the folder into your projects and add the source and header files!

## Features
-> Read World Name

## Documentation
`EXTFile readExtFile(FILE* file);` extracts informations from the file and returns a "EXTFile" which is a bundle of informations
